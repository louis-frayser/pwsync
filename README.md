# pwsync
Synchronize /etc/passwd between two hosts

## Status
Currently loading pw_sync and running 'run' demostrates the passwords being read and compared.  
The program jams looking for the report predicate which is possibly already implimentd in the module report.pl.  
This is the revival a project from Sep 2008.
